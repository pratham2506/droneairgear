                <p>Amazed by Al's knowledge + teaching abilities. Exceeded all my expectations! Especially enjoyed the GUI automation. Actually wish I would have found this course while I was still working in tech years ago...could have written myself scripts and saved our Engineering team (and myself) lots of time. Over the past two weeks have written scripts that save time at work and even a couple for the wife (who now thinks I'm brilliant) so that's pretty great.</p>
