            <h1>NFC Payment Gateway</h1>
            <p>
            Near Field Communication (NFC) is a wireless communication technology that enables the exchange of data between two devices within a short range of up to 10 cm

</h1>

            <p>
            NFC technology operates on the principles of RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) and allows for communication between two devices through electromagnetic induction.Instead of opening an application, then waiting it to respond, opening the scanner, then at last adding the amount takes up time whereas the NFC tag will be tapped and we will be directed to the adding the amount section which will save a lot of time.
